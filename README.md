# Adventure-Game

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a text-based adventure game I made using Python.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I used a decision tree to create different paths for the user depending on their choices, and created a method to handle the player's win/lose state. I also allowed the user to collect items along the way.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Downloading the file and opening it in the terminal will allow you to play the game.</p>
